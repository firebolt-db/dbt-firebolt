Parsing Error
  
  Seeds cannot depend on other nodes. dbt detected a seed with a pre- or post-hook
  that calls 'ref', 'source', or 'metric', either directly or indirectly via other macros.
  
  Error raised for 'seed.test.example_seed', which has these hooks defined: 
  - post_hook: "select * from {{ ref('post') }}"
