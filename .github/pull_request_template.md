<!---
  The PR title should indicate what has changed and should be in the active voice,
  e.g. "Added new macro to enable x" or "Fixed run twice bug".
  This makes auto-generated release notes more valuable, as they use PR titles,
  not descriptions. Note that PR titles must be prefixed with specific _lowercased_
  prefixes followed by a colon. Allowable prefixes are:
  • feat: A new feature
  • fix: A bug fix
  • docs: Documentation-only changes
  • style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
  • refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  • perf: A code change that improves performance
  • test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
  • build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
  • ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
  • chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
  • revert: Reverts a previous commit
