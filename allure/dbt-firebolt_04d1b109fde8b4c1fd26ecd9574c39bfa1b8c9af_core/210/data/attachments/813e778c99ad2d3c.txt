Summary of encountered deprecations:
- MissingArgumentsPropertyInGenericTestDeprecation: 1 occurrence
To see all deprecation instances instead of just the first occurrence of each,
run command again with the `--show-all-deprecations` flag. You may also need to
run with `--no-partial-parse` as some deprecations are only encountered during
parsing.
