# Changelog

## v.1.0.4

### Under the hood

- dbt-firebolt now supports append-only incremental models.
- Rendering of SQL output was reformatted to increase legibility of debug output and log files.

## v.1.0.3

### Under the hood

- Dev requirements are now in setup.cfg and not dev-requirements.txt.
- dbt-firebolt now requires firebolt-sdk v.0.6 to allow for SET variables to be set in pre-hooks.

## v.1.0.2

### Under the hood

- dbt-firebolt now supports aggregating indexes with multiple-column keys. 
- Bug fix to check for `data_type` and `regex` fields when necessary on external tables.
- Changed default behavior on external table insert to `DROP IF EXISTS`.

### Breaking changes

- Models with aggregating and join indexes now require `index_type` field in index config blocks rather than `type`.

## v.1.0.1

### Under the hood

- Updated seed behavior. Seed now does a `DROP <table_name> CASCADE` followed by a `CREATE TABLE <table_name>` rather than `TRUNCATE`, which was not working consistently.

## v.1.0.0

- dbt-firebolt now supports dbt 1.0+!

## v.0.21.10

### Breaking changes

- We now use our [DB-API](https://github.com/firebolt-db/firebolt-python-sdk) rather than our JDBC.

## v.0.21.4

### Changes

- Views are now officially supported with dbt-firebolt! [#22](https://github.com/firebolt-db/dbt-firebolt/pull/22) and [#25](https://github.com/firebolt-db/dbt-firebolt/pull/25).

### Under the hood

- Added GitHub templates for PRs and issues.
- Added linting using Black, Flake8, and iSort. This necessitated the addition of a `setup.cfg` file, so an additional linter, `setup-cfg-fmt` was added to check that file. These linters are all pre-commit hooks, so will force any future commits to abide by our style. [#20](https://github.com/firebolt-db/dbt-firebolt/pull/20).
- Indefinitely removed `setup.cfg` from project [#29](https://github.com/firebolt-db/dbt-firebolt/pull/29).
